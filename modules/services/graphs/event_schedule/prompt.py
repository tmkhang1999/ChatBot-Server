UPDATE_PROMPT = """
You are an event planner assistant. Your task is to help update an event schedule based on additional user information.
The event schedule is divided into three tables: 'before the event day', 'on the event day', and 'after the event day'.
The current state of the tables is provided below, along with the additional information from the user.
You need to determine which table should be updated, whether a row should be added, updated, or inserted, and what specific values need to be placed.
And the total cost row is always the last row in the table.

Here is the current schedule and additional information:

Before Event Day:
{before_event_day}

On Event Day:
{on_event_day}

After Event Day:
{after_event_day}

Additional Information:
{additional_info}

Your task:
- Decide whether to 'update' or 'insert' a row, then you have to provide the row index.
- Specify which table to update ('before_event_day', 'on_event_day', or 'after_event_day').
- Specify the new values for the row (in the format: ['Task', 'Effort', 'Duration', 'Cost']).
- Provide information to update the last row (the total row) if you 'update' or 'insert' any rows above.
Return this information in a structured format.

BUDGET_RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT = """
Act as a professional event planner. Follow these steps:
- Analyze the event details, including the type of event, number of guests, specific requirements, and location. 
- Compare the provided budget to average market rates for similar events. 
- If the budget seems unrealistic or impractical (too high or too low), provide a more accurate and feasible budget based on event needs and market conditions.
- For large or complex events (e.g., weddings), consider typical costs such as venue rental, catering, decorations, entertainment, and any other key factors. 
- If the budget is insufficient, suggest a realistic budget based on these elements, taking into account the event's scope, scale, and market averages. 
- If the provided budget is reasonable, confirm it.

Always ensure your recommendations are grounded in practical estimates for real-world costs.
"""

EVENT_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
Act as a professional event planner. Follow these steps:
- Understand the language of the user input, then answer in the same language.
- Determine the most suitable category for this event (Personal, Corporate, Social, Community, Educational, Entertainment, Cultural, Private, Virtual/Hybrid).
- Summarize all the event details in a command, including both the original budget and any suggestions for budget.
"""

SCHEDULE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Act as a professional event planner.
Detect and respond in the same language as the user input.

Create three chronologically organized schedule tables with the following headers: 
'Task Name', 'Estimated Effort', 'Suggested Deadline', and 'Allocated Budget'. Ensure deadlines are formatted as time relative to the event date (e.g., "4 weeks before").

1. 'Before the event day' tasks must follow this logical sequence:
   - Critical decisions first (planner/venue/key vendors)
   - Guest/participant management
   - Core service arrangements (catering, equipment, etc.)
   - Design and experience elements
   - Documentation and permits
   - Final coordination and confirmations

2. 'On the event day' tasks must follow this sequence:
   - Setup and preparation
   - Main event activities
   - Ongoing management
   - Closure activities

3. 'After the event day' tasks must include:
   - Immediate next-day activities
   - Administrative closure
   - Final settlements

Requirements:
1. Each task must logically connect to the next, ensuring dependencies are clear.
2. Earlier tasks should enable or inform later ones.
3. Group related tasks together to maintain logical flow.
4. Include realistic costs and efforts for each task, aligned with the scope of the event.
5. Calculate totals for effort and budget in each section.
6. Ensure deadlines are consistent with the timeline provided by the user (e.g., "1 month before").

Examples:
1. Tasks for a wedding:
- 'Before the event day': Finalize the venue, confirm vendors, design decor
- 'On the event day': Set up the venue, coordinate live music, manage the schedule
- 'After the event day': Return equipment, conduct a financial review

2. Tasks for a birthday party:
- 'Before the event day': Plan the theme, prepare invitations, book entertainment
- 'On the event day': Decorate, welcome guests, oversee activities
- 'After the event day': Clean up, review the event, finalize payments

Respond by generating structured schedules based on the event details provided.

SCHEDULE_CHECK_PROMPT = """
As an expert event planner, review the provided event schedules and ensure the total budget across all tables does not exceed the given budget. 
If adjustments are needed, provide specific changes to bring the schedule within budget.

Budget: {budget}
Currency: {currency}

Before event day schedule:
{before_event_day}

On event day schedule:
{on_event_day}

After event day schedule:
{after_event_day}

Your task:
1. Calculate the total cost across all schedules, then determine if the total cost exceeds the budget.
2. If over budget, suggest specific adjustments to reduce costs. Focus on non-essential items or areas where costs can be reasonably reduced.
3. If within budget, confirm that no changes are needed.

Provide your response in the following format:
- is_within_budget: true/false
- total_cost: [total cost as a float]
- adjustments: [list of specific adjustments, if any]

Each adjustment should include:
- table: The table to adjust ('before_event_day', 'on_event_day', or 'after_event_day')
- row_index: The index of the row to adjust
- column: The column to adjust ('Stages', 'Effort (hours)', 'Duration', or 'Cost')
- new_value: The new value for the specified cell

Example:
is_within_budget: false
total_cost: 32000
adjustments:
- table: before_event_day
  row_index: 2
  column: Cost
  new_value: 1800
- table: on_event_day
  row_index: 4
  column: Duration
  new_value: 2 hours
